- Web browsers begin with a user interface whihc is what the user interacts with, such as a search bar. The rendering engine constructs the page and takes in html and css documents. The browseer engine then directs actions between the interface and rendering engine. It recieves content asking for images, documents etc. This rendering path creates the DOM tree. The DOM tree is then the render tree because it goes through a layout process which allows the user to now interect with the nodes from the DOM tree.

- The DOM is an interface that helps the structure and content of a document by using a “tree structure”. This structure is made up of nodes. These nodes hold images, buttons, lists, etc. They go through the layout process which defines the location/size of each element. Then the nodes are visible on the screen. 

- HTMl is the foundation and structure for a pages content. It displays the document nodes. XML describes these nodes. XHTML can help correct problems for smaller devices. 

- The purpose of the index page is for when the browser cannot specify a file, it will automatically look for the index.

•  <!DOCTYPE>. 
•  < root> 
•  < head>
•  < body>
