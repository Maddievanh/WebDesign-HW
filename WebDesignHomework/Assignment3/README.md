## Questions & Notes

**Questions**

My main question is about the usage of _"Lorem_ _Ipsum"_ when creating our README files. Is there a specific one we are meant to use, or can we fill it with whatever we want? Such as any words at all or should it always be lorem ipsum as a place holder? I am curious if there is a shorcut as well. I tried to look for it incase this information was already provided but I could not. I was not sure if I should be using the same one or copy one from online, or if it is not important at all. 

**Notes**

- GitHub repositories, at first was a struggle but I practiced multiple times now can do it without help
- Relearning code, struggled remembering everything so I found a sheet on github that helps learn/practice
- Working in VSC, it is super easy to mess up. Simple as a space in the wrong spot- remember the rules has been tough but practicing will help
